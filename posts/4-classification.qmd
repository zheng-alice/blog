<!-- Describe the algorithms, theories, and applications related to machine learning/data mining for classification. -->


Classification is a **supervised learning** method, much like [regression](3-regression.qmd).
Unlike [regression](3-regression.qmd), it predicts features not continuous, but categorical and unordered.
Such features then denote the *class* that each point belongs to - not unlike assigning a cluster.
Indeed, both classification and [clustering](2-clustering.qmd) work with data that is typically sufficiently distinct, that they must then learn to separate into groups.
The crucial difference is that classification is given the *labels* of the training data, which it then must generalize to the *testing* set.

Various considerations and regimes for classification exist:

* **Offline vs. online:** most algorithms are of the former type, where they are given data first and queried only after all such data has been made available.
  On the contrary, others such as [bandit algorithms](1-probability.qmd#multi-armed-bandits) and [changepoint detection](5-anomaly.qmd#changepoint-detection) learn only by making mistakes on the already evaluated examples.
  While such algorithms commonly relate to reinforcement learning, they could be applied to all kinds of areas - including clustering and classification.
* **Eager vs. lazy:** out of the offline algorithms, some may choose not to even process given data, instead only looking at it when being queried.
  Such algorithms are known as lazy; one example would be $k$-nearest neighbors classification.
* **Binary/multi-class/multi-label:** the most straightforward type of classification is distinguishing between two classes, or equivalently answering a yes/no question.
  Many algorithms extend to output one of many clusters, yet some others need nontrivial modifications.
  Lastly, specially-generalized algorithms exist that can assign multiple class labels to one point.
* **Balanced/imbalanced:** many algorithms assume that the ground truth clusters are of approximately the same size.
  Yet, many datasets have an abundance of one label compared to another - such as when detecting a rare disease.
  In such cases, certain assumptions may break down; for instance, having a dataset with $95%$ labels class $A$ and $5%$ class $B$ makes the trivial algorithm that always picks $A$ perform with $95%$ accuracy.
  As such, the "random" baseline is now $95%$ instead of $50%$.
  This imbalance can force even the more powerful models to shy away from predicting the rare class, stumping learning.
  To combat this, one can apply strategies such as *oversampling* and *undersampling*.

## Learning theory

Before we dive into specific algorithms and their applications, it would be useful to review the mathematical theory behind clustering (and machine learning more broadly).
This is a fairly mature and encompassing theory, being an umbrella term for many important concepts such as VC theory, online learning, and PAC learning.

Suppose we have some unknown target function $f^\dagger: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ that maps data to labels.
We wish to model this function, but the only information we have about it is how it acts on the data.
In addition, we only have a finite amount of training examples $D = \{(x_1,y_1), \ldots (x_n,y_n)\} \sim \mathcal{D}$.
We wish to approximate $f^\dagger$ via some other function $\hat{f}$ that not only maps each $x_i \mapsto y_i$, but also *generalizes* to doing this for any $(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}$.
The approximation $\hat{f}$ will instead map $x$ to some $\hat{y}$, and to measure the quality of this output, we will choose a *loss function* $L(\hat{y},y)$ of interest (often, the indicator function).
More formally, we can evaluate an approximation $f$ via its **risk**, defined as
$$
R(f) = \mathbb{E}[L(f(x), y)] = \int L(f(x), y) \mathrm{dP}(x,y)\ .
$$ {#eq-risk}

This metric choice may seem a bit odd, but necessary since sampling $(x,y)$ from $\mathcal{D}$ means they are [random variables](1-probability.qmd#random-variables).
In addition, we can't even evaluate the above quantity since we don't know $\mathcal{D}$ in the first place.

So, what to do?
Instead, we just evaluate on the available data to obtain the **empirical risk** of $f$,
$$
R_\text{emp}(f) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n L(f(x_i), y_i)\ .
$$ {#eq-empirical}

Outside of learning theory, risk and empirical risk may be referred to as testing and training accuracy.

The next question is how to find our approximation $\hat{f}$.
To do this, we need to start with picking a *hypothesis class* $\mathcal{H}$, representing all possible models (and parameters) we could potentially end up with.
We then compute
$$
\hat{f} = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{H}} R_\text{emp}(f)\ ,
$$ {#eq-fhat}

and hope that it is close to
$$
f^* = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{H}} R(f)\ .
$$ {#eq-fstar}

So, at this point we have already accumulated a couple potential sources of error.
The following picture helps to illustrate them.

![Image credit: [Han Bao](https://hermite.jp/post/erm-optimal-convergence-rate/).](https://hermite.jp/img/201802/estimation-approximation-error.png){width=50%}

When restricting ourselves to $\mathcal{H}$, we demoted the best attainable function from $f^\dagger$ to $f^*$ resulting in an [approximation error]{.red}.
Then, since we only have a limited-size dataset, the best possible approximation to $f^*$ we can get is $\hat{f}$, which incurs an [estimation error]{.blue}.

So, what should we do to minimize these errors?
The quality of the [approximation]{.red} primarily depends on the chosen hypothesis class - making it include more complex models decreases the error.
As for [estimation]{.blue}, there are various bounds that relate it to parameters; though, the common theme is that generalization is improved with a larger $|D| = n$ and a smaller $|\mathcal{H}|$.
However, the latter condition seems almost directly contradictory to the one we need for better approximations, i.e., more complex models.
The following graphic illustrates this tradeoff (occasionally also referred to as the underfitting/overfitting or bias/variance tradeoff)

![Tradeoff of estimation and approximation errors.](tradeoff.svg){width=50%}

So, is all lost?
Not exactly; the conditions aren't directly contradictory - we could minimize both by finding an $\mathcal{H}$ that contains as few models as possible, but the ones it contains are accurate at modeling the desired data.
This is a task easier said than done, as we need to carefully discard all unnecessary models, while making sure the important ones are retained.
The search for such a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ is perhaps what drives the creation of many various types of machine learning algorithms.


## Simple dataset

We start our evaluation by analyzing one of the algorithms featured in @fig-classification (second column from the right), **Naive Bayes**.
We can see that it performs fairly well on the artificial data, separating it sufficiently but also generalizing smoothly to outside of the provided domain.
Let's see how it fares against data with a couple more dimensions.

### Naive Bayes

But first, a small introduction of the algorithm itself (mostly based on its [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) article).
As evident by its name, it relies on Bayes' theorem
$$
\mathrm{P}(k | x) = \frac{\mathrm{P}(x | k) \mathrm{P}(k)}{\mathrm{P}(x)}\ ,
$$ {#eq-bayes}

where $k$ is the event of the data $x = x_1, \ldots x_n$ belonging to class $k$.
Naturally, the quantity on the left of @eq-bayes is exactly what would let us perform classification, so we use the quantity on the right (ignoring the denominator as it doesn't depend on $k$) to compute it.
The numerator is equal to $\mathrm{P}(x, k)$, which we may by chain rule write as
$$
\mathrm{P}(x_1, \ldots, x_n, k)
= \mathrm{P}(x_1 | x_2, \ldots x_n, k) \mathrm{P}(x_2 | x_3, \ldots x_n, k) \dots \mathrm{P}(x_n, k) \mathrm{P}(k)\ .
$$ {#eq-chain}

To go further, we need an assumption - the *conditional independence* (a.k.a. naive Bayes) assumption.
Specifically, we have that $\mathrm{P}(x_i | x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n, k) = \mathrm{P} (x_i | k)$, and thus
$$
\mathrm{P}(k | x) \propto \mathrm{P}(k, x) = \mathrm{P}(k) \prod_{i=1}^n \mathrm{P}(x_i | k)\ .
$$ {#eq-naive}

### Iris

I don't think this dataset really needs an introduction, you've almost certainly seen it before.
In any case, it has four features that describe the length and width of flower petals and sepals, as seen below.

![Image credit: [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html).](https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2015/principal_component_analysis_files/iris.png){width=75%}

The question is; could you tell which of the following three flowers you're looking at?

![Image credit: [Gaurav Chauhan](https://machinelearninghd.com/iris-dataset-uci-machine-learning-repository-project/).](https://machinelearninghd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iris-dataset.png)

Except, you wouldn't be actually looking at the flowers but instead just those four numbers.
It may instead be easier to see the difference if the values are plotted laterally.
Below, petal length is denoted by size and petal width by transparency.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 2D scatterplot of iris
import plotly.express as px
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

iris = px.data.iris().drop('species_id', axis=1)
fig = px.scatter(iris, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", size="petal_length",
    color="species", marginal_y="violin", marginal_x="violin",
    template="simple_white", hover_data=['petal_width'])
op = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0.5, 1.0)).fit_transform(
    iris['petal_width'].values[:, None])
fig.update_traces(marker=dict(opacity=op), selector=dict(mode='markers'))
fig.show();
```

Or, perhaps in a 3D plot that shows all four features (petal length is still marker size).

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 3D scatterplot of iris
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter_3d(iris, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", z="petal_width",
    size="petal_length", color="species", template="simple_white")
fig.show();
```

I don't know about you, but some of the points between versicolor and virginia still seem pretty overlapping.
Let's see how the algorithm compares!


### Evaluation

Lucky for us, Naive Bayes is a common algorithm with many implementations.
We'll be using one by `sklearn`.

```{python}
#| code-summary: Naive bayes classifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score

# Fit and predict
X, y = iris.drop('species', axis=1), iris['species']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=5805)
nb = GaussianNB().fit(X_train, y_train)
iris['predict'] = nb.predict(X)
y_pred = nb.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy:  {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.4f}\n"
      f"Precision: {precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro'):.4f}")
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Code for plotting the confusion matrix
#| fig-align: center
import seaborn as sn
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

names = iris['species'].unique()
conf = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
df_cm = pd.DataFrame(conf, index=names, columns=names)
plt.figure(figsize = (4,3))
sn.heatmap(df_cm, annot=True, fmt='d');
```

From the above, we can gauge the performance as quite good - the algorithm only mislabels $4$ points out of a testing set of size $75$, while being given a training set of only size $75$.

Let's see where it made mistakes.
Predictions are denoted by outline colors, points where the inner color doesn't match are mislabeled.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 2D scatterplot of iris & predictions
import numpy as np

fix = {"circle": "#1F77B4", "diamond": "#FF7F0E", "square": "#2CA02C"}
fig = px.scatter(iris, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", size="petal_length",
    color="species", symbol="predict",
    template="simple_white", hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.update_traces(marker=dict(opacity=op), selector=dict(mode='markers'))
for symbol, color in fix.items():
    fig.update_traces(marker=dict(line=dict(width=3, color=color),
                      symbol="circle"),
                      selector=dict(mode='markers', marker_symbol=symbol))
fig.show();
```

As expected, only a few points are mislabeled.
There were a tiny bit more than in the confusion matrix, as the scatterplot includes both the training and testing sets.

We can also display this on the 3D plot, but it unfortunately has a bug where the outline thickness cannot be increased and is barely visible.
To compensate, predicted classes are additionally denoted by the marker shape.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: 3D scatterplot of iris & predictions
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter_3d(iris, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", z="petal_width",
    size="petal_length", color="species", symbol="predict",
    template="simple_white")
for symbol, color in fix.items():
    fig.update_traces(marker=dict(line=dict(color=color)),
                      selector=dict(mode='markers', marker_symbol=symbol))
fig.show();
```

This makes the mislabeled points a bit easier to identify, revealing that there are $6$ in total.


## Complex dataset

That seems to have been too easy.
Let's try something harder.

### MNIST

Once again, you've probably seen this one before.
The data consists of hand-drawn digits, which we must then classify.

![Image credit: [Orhan G. Yalçın](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-classification-in-10-minutes-with-mnist-dataset-54c35b77a38d).](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*XdCMCaHPt-pqtEibUfAnNw.png)

### Neural network

Due to the high-dimensionality of the data, we now need to look beyond classical machine learning methods.
One approach that has gained widespread popularity over the last decade is **deep learning**, i.e., models with many layers to model complex semantics.

Such models are commonly **neural networks** - architectures supposedly inspired by neurons in a brain.
Each neuron takes inputs from several others, aggregates them (plus a bias), then passes through an activation function and onto the next layer.
The nonlinearity of the activation step in particular makes it possible for complex behaviors to arise from this structure.
Another important reason for these networks being so widespread is that the neurons are neatly arranged in layers, making their associated operations efficiently computable via *matrix multiplication* - an operation with abundant hardware dedicated to it thanks to computer graphics.

In the following example, we'll be using a special type of neural network - a **convolutional** neural net (CNN) - specifically designed to process image inputs.
Its layers replace the fully-connected structure by the convolution of a single kernel of weights.
This makes the patterns learned by the kernels applicable to many parts of the image, reduces the number of model parameters (lower $|\mathcal{H}|$ - good!) while being able to model data effectively (lower approximation error - good!), and introducing spatial locality into the architecture.

For this example, we'll be mostly following this [`pytorch` tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).
First, load and normalize the dataset.
Note that `pytorch` does this through a class called `DataLoader`, which has the benefit of avoiding storing the entire dataset in memory.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Import pytorch
import torch
from torch import nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.datasets import MNIST
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.optim as optim

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
print(f"Using device: {device}")
```

```{python}
#| code-summary: Load and preprocess data
#| output: false
transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.5), (0.5))
    ])
batch_size = 4

trainset = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

names = list(range(10))
```

Now, define the actual neural network.
I've condensed[^runtime] it quite a bit from the tutorial, keeping the two convolutional layers but removing some dense layers at the end.

[^runtime]: As I'm running this code via GitHub actions, it runs on cpu.
I don't want to spend too long deploying, so I've simplified the model accordingly.

```{python}
#| code-summary: Create a neural network
class NeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 3, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(6 * 4 * 4, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = NeuralNet()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```

### Evaluation

And now, let's actually train and evaluate it.
If you're following along, this step can take quite a while...

```{python}
#| code-summary: Train a neural network
# Do one pass over the dataset
for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
    inputs, labels = data

    # Resent the gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Forward/backward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Evaluate network
y_test, y_pred = [], []
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        inputs, labels = data
        outputs = model(inputs)
        _, pred = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        y_test.extend(labels)
        y_pred.extend(pred)
print(f"Accuracy:  {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.4f}\n"
      f"Precision: {precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro'):.4f}")
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Code for plotting the confusion matrix
#| fig-align: center
conf = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
df_cm = pd.DataFrame(conf, index=names, columns=names)
plt.figure(figsize = (8.5,7))
sn.heatmap(df_cm, annot=True, fmt='d');
```

Yay, it's finished!
The performance above is not too shabby, although bigger and better-trained models should attain a few more percent of accuracy.

The adjacency matrix also reveals some digit pairs that commonly confuse the model.
Let's find some mislabeled examples to see how fair they are.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show test samples with mistakes
#| layout-ncol: 4
import torchvision
import numpy as np

# Get samples where mistakes were made
def wrong(dataloader):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(testloader):
        for j, (image, label) in enumerate(zip(images, labels)):
            label, pred = label.item(), y_pred[batch_size*i+j].item()
            if pred != label:
                yield (image, label, pred)

# Plot several examples
loader = wrong(testloader)
for _ in range(4):
    image, label, pred = next(loader)
    img = np.transpose(image, (1, 2, 0))
    plt.imshow(img, cmap='Greys')
    plt.title(f"Actual: {label}\nPredicted: {pred}", size=42)
    plt.xticks([],[])
    plt.yticks([],[])
    plt.show()
```

Personally, I think these are still very comprehensible, maybe just a bit unusual.
Even though the model does not get these, it apparently does many more - which I think is fair to call a success.
